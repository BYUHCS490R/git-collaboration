Aloha! I'm Alema Stone -- I'm a Senior majoring in CS and minoring in CFM and Pacific Island Studies.

I'm really excited to actually build something in this class, and learning about all of the steps that come along with that. 

I have a couple of ideas for a project, but I haven't settled on anything yet..
Idea 1 --> A ticketing software that stores and manages basic customer info for a business.
Idea 2 --> A VoC (Voice of Customer) system that asks customers about their experience in a business.
Idea 3 --> Group messaging platform (similar to Messenger/WhatsApp) for coaches to connect with their players/players parents without them needing to download an app.
There's plenty more ideas but I'm not quite sure which option to go with..
