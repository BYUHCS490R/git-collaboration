I am Hyun Kim and I am from Korea. I am an aspiring back-end engineer.

In this class, I want to learn how to structure a full web application from front to back.

My project idea is to build a platform where BYUH students can buy, sell, or auction items in a safe and trusted campus community environment. It would include user accounts, item listings, bidding or direct sales, and possibly a chat or notification system.
