Aloha! My name is Yaz Russel N. Darasin all the way from the Northern part of the Philippines, Tuguegarao City which is known for being the hottest city in our country. I'm a junior in Brigham Young University - Hawaii who is majoring in Computer Science. 

The idea that I wanted to create is a website to support people (students) struggling with their mental health by connecting them with a volunteer, which I refer them as 'Buddy', who can offer emotional support. The platform will allow each individual to chat with each other anonymously, so we can keep both parties personal information private. I thought about this because many people really can't affort professional counseling or for most of the time they prefer to keep their struggles as a secret, we respect that though we highly encourage them to speak up for themselves and seek help. Everyone deserves someone to talk to, that's the reason why this website seek for volunteers who are willing to listen, understand, and help them through the most toughest time. Another feature that I am thinking to include is an option to either speak with professionals or keep it simple and connect with supportive volunteers for casual conversation. So, probably I will need to let the users sign-in to save all of the previous conversation.
