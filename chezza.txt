Hi, my name is Chezza Bomediano from the Philippines and a junior studying Computer Science. I like the sound of keyboards (not the clacky ones), 
somehow the sound pushes me to also be productive, and I like being productive. 

The project I am planning to create is a delivery or errand web app, called Campus Dash or a simple Income/Expenses tracker. 

The Campus Dash is delivery/errand web app, that a student can post or make a trip in the app saying they are going to Walmart and a schedule of 
the trip. Other students can then request to buy something from them, or pick up something. The student making the trip can accept or decline the
request. 

Another idea is a simple Income and Expenses tracker for students. I think especially International students here in BYUH needs this.
